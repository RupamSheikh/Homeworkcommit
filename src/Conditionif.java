        //Conditional statements define conditions that are true or false and then execute based on whether or not the
        //condition is true. Basically, conditions say, “If x is true, then execute y”. This logic is called an “if-statement”.

        //There are 4 types of Conditional Statement in Java
        //** if
        //** if..else
        //** Nested if..else
        //** Switch..case

        //Condition if age is >18 eligible to vote
        //if(condition){ code}
        int age = 18;
        if(age >=18); {
            System.out.println("Eligible for vote");//This line will run since age=18 condition is true
        }
